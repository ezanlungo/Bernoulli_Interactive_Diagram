# Moody_Diagram
Python project aimed at developing a Reynolds number calculator.

Python project aimed at developing a pipeline friction factor calculator for different fluid flow regimes.
The Newton-Raphson method is utilized to obtain the roots of the working function, and based on the solution of the Moody's equation,
a graph is generated that presents user-inputted data of Reynolds number and friction factor, along with the associated curve, to return the friction factor.
